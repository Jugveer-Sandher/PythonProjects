# PythonProjects

## This repository shows my skills in the following:

- Install and set-up Python.

- Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs.

- Create simple algorithms for solving simple problems.

- Choose the appropriate data structure for modeling a given problem.

- Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task.

- Apply the techniques of decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.

- Refactor a program by identifying opportunities to apply procedural abstraction.

- Write programs that use primitive data types, variables, expressions, and command line I/O.

- Write programs that use conditional and iterative control structures, functions, and parameter passing.

- Write programs that use each of the following data structures: lists, strings, sets, and dictionaries.

- Write programs using the standard libraries available with a chosen programming language.

- Write programs that use file I/O to provide persistence across multiple executions.

- Design and implement a class.

- Apply a variety of strategies to the testing and debugging of simple programs.

- Conduct a personal code review on a program component.

- Contribute to a small-team code walkthrough.
